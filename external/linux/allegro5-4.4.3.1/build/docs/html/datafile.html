<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>

<p>
An Allegro datafile is a bit like a zip file in that it consists of lots of 
different pieces of data stuck together one after another, and optionally 
compressed. This means that your game doesn't have to clutter up the disk 
with hundreds of tiny files, and it makes programming easier because you can 
load everything with a single function call at program startup. Another 
benefit is that the LZSS file compression algorithm works much better with 
one large file than with many small ones.

<p>
Datafiles have the extension .dat, and can be created and edited with the 
graphical grabber program or the command line dat utility. They can be 
stored as separate files and loaded into memory by the load_datafile() 
function, or you can use dat2s to convert them into asm code which can then 
be linked directly into your executable.

<p>
<h1><a name="Objects">Objects</a></h1>

<p>
Each datafile contains a number of objects, of varying types. Object types 
are represented by 32 bit integer ID's, which are interpreted as four 
character ASCII strings. These ID's can be constructed with the DAT_ID() 
macro, for example a DATA object is represented by DAT_ID('D','A','T','A'), 
or you can use the predefined DAT_* constants for the standard data types:

<p>
<ul><li>
DAT_FILE - "FILE"<br>
   A datafile, which contains a list of other objects. Datafile objects 
   can be nested inside other datafiles, allowing you to create 
   hierarchical structures of any depth.

<li>DAT_DATA - "DATA"<br>
   A block of binary data. Allegro treats all unknown types as binary 
   data objects, so you don't need to use this ID: you can create custom 
   object formats using whatever ID's you like.

<li>DAT_FONT - "FONT"<br>
   A font.

<li>DAT_SAMPLE - "SAMP"<br>
   A digital sound sample.

<li>DAT_MIDI - "MIDI"<br>
   A MIDI file.

<li>DAT_PATCH - "PAT "<br>
   A Gravis patch (MIDI instrument).

<li>DAT_FLI - "FLIC"<br>
   An FLI or FLC animation.

<li>DAT_BITMAP - "BMP "<br>
   A bitmap.

<li>DAT_RLE_SPRITE - "RLE "<br>
   A run length encoded sprite.

<li>DAT_C_SPRITE - "CMP "<br>
   A compiled sprite.

<li>DAT_XC_SPRITE - "XCMP"<br>
   A mode-X compiled sprite.

<li>DAT_PALETTE - "PAL "<br>
   A 256 color palette.

<li>DAT_PROPERTY - "prop"<br>
   An object property (see below). You will never directly encounter this 
   object type, but you should be aware that it is treated specially by 
   the datafile code.

<li>DAT_INFO - "info"<br>
   The grabber utility uses this object to store information about the 
   datafile. Like property objects, you ought never to encounter it, but 
   you should avoid using the ID for any custom object formats you create.

<li>DAT_END - -1<br>
   Special marker used to indicate the end of a datafile.
</ul>

<p>
<h1><a name="Properties">Properties</a></h1>

<p>
Each object can have any number of properties attached to it. These are 
ASCII strings describing attributes of the object, such as its name and 
where it came from. Like the objects themselves, properties are identified 
by 32 bit integer ID's which are constructed from four character strings by 
the DAT_ID() macro. Allegro defines the standard properties:

<p>
<ul><li>
"NAME"<br>
   The name of the object.
<li>
"ORIG"<br>
   The object's origin, ie. the name of the file from which it was 
   grabbed.
<li>
"DATE"<br>
   A timestamp, used by the update command in the grabber and dat 
   utilities. This is the modification time of the file from which the 
   object was grabbed, in "m-dd-yyyy, hh:mm" format.
<li>
"XPOS"<br>
   For bitmap objects which were grabbed from part of a larger image, the 
   x position of the origin within the parent bitmap.
<li>
"YPOS"<br>
   For bitmap objects which were grabbed from part of a larger image, the 
   y position of the origin within the parent bitmap.
<li>
"XSIZ"<br>
   For bitmap objects which were grabbed from part of a larger image, the 
   width of the selected region.
<li>
"YSIZ"<br>
   For bitmap objects which were grabbed from part of a larger image, the 
   height of the selected region.
<li>
"XCRP"<br>
   For autocropped bitmap objects, the amount of cropping on the left of
   the image.
<li>
"YCRP"<br>
   For autocropped bitmap objects, the amount of cropping at the top of 
   the image.
</ul>

<p>
You can use whatever other ID's you like to store custom information about 
your objects (the grabber internally use some other properties stored in a 
hidden DAT_INFO object, so they won't conflict with yours).

<p>
In case anyone wants to do some serious hackery, and for my own future 
reference, here are some details of the innards of the datafile format.

<p>
Note that this is different to the datafile format used by Allegro versions 
2.1 and earlier. Allegro can still load files from the old format, but it 
was much less flexible and didn't support nice things like object 
properties, so you should load any old files into the grabber and save them 
out again to convert to the new format.

<p>
Nb. if all you want to do is write a utility that manipulates datafiles in 
some way, the easiest approach is probably to use the helper functions in 
datedit.c, which are currently shared by the dat, dat2s, and grabber 
programs. These functions handle loading, saving, inserting and deleting 
objects, and modifying the contents of datafiles in various ways, but life 
is too short for me to bother documenting them all here. Look at the 
source...

<p>
Anyway. All numbers are stored in big-endian (Motorola) format. All text is 
stored in UTF-8 encoding. A datafile begins with one of the 32 bit values 
F_PACK_MAGIC or F_NOPACK_MAGIC, which are defined in allegro.h. If it starts 
with F_PACK_MAGIC the rest of the file is compressed with the LZSS 
algorithm, otherwise it is uncompressed. This magic number and optional 
decompression can be handled automatically by using the packfile functions 
and opening the file in F_READ_PACKED mode. After this comes the 32 bit 
value DAT_MAGIC, followed by the number of objects in the root datafile (not 
including objects nested inside child datafiles), followed by each of those 
objects in turn.

<p>
Each object is in the format:

<blockquote class="text"><pre>
   OBJECT =
      var    - &lt;property list&gt;      - any properties relating to the object
      32 bit - &lt;type ID&gt;            - object type ID
      32 bit - &lt;compressed size&gt;    - size of the raw data in the file
      32 bit - &lt;uncompressed size&gt;  - see below
      var    - &lt;data&gt;               - the contents of the object
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The property list can contain zero or more object properties, in the form:

<blockquote class="text"><pre>
   PROPERTY =
      32 bit - &lt;magic&gt;              - "prop"
      32 bit - &lt;type ID&gt;            - property type ID
      32 bit - &lt;size&gt;               - size of the property string, in bytes
      var    - &lt;data&gt;               - property string, _not_ null-terminated
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If the uncompressed size field in an object is positive, the contents of the 
object are not compressed (ie. the raw and compressed sizes should be the 
same). If the uncompressed size is negative, the object is LZSS compressed, 
and will expand into -&lt;uncompressed size&gt; bytes of data. The easiest way to 
handle this is to use the pack_fopen_chunk() function to read both the raw 
and compressed sizes and the contents of the object.

<p>
The contents of an object vary depending on the type. Allegro defines the 
standard types:

<blockquote class="text"><pre>
   DAT_FILE =
      32 bit - &lt;object count&gt;       - number of objects in the sub-file
      var    - &lt;object list&gt;        - objects in the same format as above

   DAT_FONT =
      16 bit - &lt;font size&gt;          - 8, 16, -1, or 0

      if font size == 8 {           - obsolete as of version 3.9.x!
         unsigned char[95][8]       - 8x8 bit-packed font data
      }

      if font size == 16 {          - obsolete as of version 3.9.x!
         unsigned char[95][16]      - 8x16 bit-packed font data
      }

      if font size == -1 {          - obsolete as of version 3.9.x!
         95x {
            16 bit - &lt;width&gt;        - character width
            16 bit - &lt;height&gt;       - character height
            var    - &lt;data&gt;         - character data (8 bit pixels)
         }
      }

      if font size == 0 {           - new format introduced in version 3.9.x
         16 bit - &lt;ranges&gt;          - number of character ranges
         for each range {
            8 bit  - &lt;mono&gt;         - 1 or 8 bit format flag
            32 bit - &lt;start&gt;        - first character in range
            32 bit - &lt;end&gt;          - last character in range (inclusive)
            for each character {
               16 bit - &lt;width&gt;     - character width
               16 bit - &lt;height&gt;    - character height
               var    - &lt;data&gt;      - character data
            }
         } 
      }

   DAT_SAMP =
      16 bit - &lt;bits&gt;               - sample bits (negative for stereo)
      16 bit - &lt;freq&gt;               - sample frequency
      32 bit - &lt;length&gt;             - sample length
      var    - &lt;data&gt;               - sample data

   DAT_MIDI =
      16 bit - &lt;divisions&gt;          - MIDI beat divisions
      32x {
         32 bit - &lt;length&gt;          - track length, in bytes
         var    - &lt;data&gt;            - MIDI track data
      }

   DAT_FLI =
      var - &lt;data&gt;                  - FLI or FLC animation, standard format

   DAT_BITMAP =
   DAT_C_SPRITE =
   DAT_XC_SPRITE =
      16 bit - &lt;bits&gt;               - bitmap color depth
      16 bit - &lt;width&gt;              - bitmap width
      16 bit - &lt;height&gt;             - bitmap height
      var    - &lt;data&gt;               - bitmap data

      Valid color depths are 8, 15, 16, 24, 32, and -32. Both 15 and 16 bit 
      images are stored in 5.6.5 RGB format, and 24 and 32 bit images as 
      8.8.8 RGB. The special -32 flag indicates that the data is in true 32 
      bit RGBA format.

   DAT_RLE_SPRITE =
      16 bit - &lt;bits&gt;               - sprite color depth
      16 bit - &lt;width&gt;              - sprite width
      16 bit - &lt;height&gt;             - sprite height
      32 bit - &lt;size&gt;               - data size, in bytes
      var    - &lt;data&gt;               - RLE compressed sprite data

      Valid color depths are 8, 15, 16, 24, 32. and -32. Both 15 and 16 bit 
      images are stored in 5.6.5 RGB format with 16 bit skip counts and EOL 
      markers, and 24 and 32 bit images as 8.8.8 RGB. with 32 bit skip 
      counts and markers. The special -32 flag indicates that the data is in 
      true 32 bit RGBA format.

   DAT_PALETTE =
      256 x {
         8 bit - &lt;red&gt;              - red component, 0-63
         8 bit - &lt;green&gt;            - green component, 0-63
         8 bit - &lt;blue&gt;             - blue component, 0-63
         8 bit - &lt;pad&gt;              - alignment padding
      }

<p>
I think that covers everything.
