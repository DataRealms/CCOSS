Note that this FAQ list is rather old, and much of it won't apply to
Allegro 4.4.  For example, the build system has completely changed.
Still, you might find some useful hints here.

<h1><a name="The giftware licence">The giftware licence</a></h1>

<p>
   The Allegro licence is absolutely clear unless you are a lawyer.
   However, it's written quite informally so this mini-FAQ tries to clarify
   some things.

<div class="faq-shift-to-right">
<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Does_the_licence_mean_that_Allegro_is_public_domain_">   Does the licence mean that Allegro is public domain?</a></b></div><br>
      No. Every Allegro contributor holds the copyright for the code he or
      she wrote. This means he or she grants you the right to use it for
      any purpose you want. But the fact that the contributor holds the
      copyright means that you e.g. cannot claim that you wrote the code.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Can_I_use_Allegro_for_commercial_purposes_">   Can I use Allegro for commercial purposes?</a></b></div><br>
      Yes.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Is_Allegro_compatible_with_licence_XXX__e_g__GPL__">   Is Allegro compatible with licence XXX (e.g. GPL)?</a></b></div><br>
      Because the Allegro licence has no restrictions on use you can combine
      it with any licence you want.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Is_Allegro_open_source__OSI__compatible_">   Is Allegro open source (OSI) compatible?</a></b></div><br>
      See the previous question. Since Allegro is compatible with about any
      license, it also is OSI compatible. It clearly is compatible with all the
      points in the OSD (open source definition). You can search the OSI
      mailing list for "Allegro" to see that OSI shares this view. (OSI
      officials still were reluctant to consider it for approval though and
      suggested to use an existing license like MIT instead.)

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="How_are_modifications_of_the_library_licensed_">   How are modifications of the library licensed?</a></b></div><br>
      You can modify Allegro and distribute the modified Allegro under
      any licence you want, but the original unmodified parts will still
      be licenced under the Allegro licence. If you offer your
      modifications to be included in the official Allegro distribution
      (e.g. by sending them to the Allegro developers mailing list) you
      automatically agree with licencing the modification under the
      Allegro licence.

<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="I_took_your_code__Will_you_sue_me_">   I took your code. Will you sue me?</a>
   Your library destroyed my PC. Who do I sue?</b></div><br>
      We are programmers not lawyers. This FAQ represents our current
      understanding of copyright law (or copyright laws in different
      countries). But given the license, which allows everything, and
      the disclaimer, which says we take no responsibility for anything,
      we really don't see how there could be any problems.

<h1><a name="DJGPP problems">DJGPP problems</a></h1>

<div class="faq-shift-to-right">
<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="What_is_this_make_program_that_I_m_supposed_to_run_">   What is this make program that I'm supposed to run?</a></b></div><br>
      Make is part of the standard djgpp distribution, in the file 
      <tt>v2gnu/mak*b.zip</tt> (whatever the latest version number is).
      You can get this from <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/</a>.


<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Make_doesn_t_work_properly_">   Make doesn't work properly.</a></b></div><br>
      Are you sure that you have installed djgpp correctly? Check the 
      instructions in the djgpp <tt>readme.1st</tt> file, and in particular confirm
      that you have set the DJGPP environment variable and added the 
      <tt>djgpp\bin</tt> directory to your path.


<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="My_djgpp_installation_is_fine__but_make_still_doesn_t_work_properly_">   My djgpp installation is fine, but make still doesn't work properly.</a></b></div><br>
      Are you sure that you are using the GNU make program, and not some 
      other version like the Borland one? If in doubt, run <tt>make -v</tt> and
      check that the GNU copyright message is displayed.


<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="When_I_run_make__it_asks_me_for_some_parameters__What_do_I_type_">   When I run make, it asks me for some parameters. What do I type?</a></b></div><br>
      You shouldn't be running make from the Win95 explorer! Bring up a DOS 
      box, change to your Allegro directory, and type <tt>make</tt> at the command
      prompt.


<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="When_I_run_make__it_says__makefile_has_modification_time_in_the_future__">   When I run make, it says "makefile has modification time in the future".</a></b></div><br>
      Are you sure that your system time and date are set correctly?
      Alternatively you may have downloaded a fresh file made by someone in a
      more eastern timezone. In the latter case you can either wait a few
      hours, temporarily set your clock forward, or use a utility such as
      <tt>touch</tt> to change the timestamp of the files.


<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="When_I_run_make__it_says__virtual_memory_exhausted__">   When I run make, it says "virtual memory exhausted".</a></b></div><br>

<p>
      As the error message suggests, you need to provide more memory for the 
      compiler to use. The <tt>go32-v2</tt> program will tell you how much is
      currently available. If you are running under DOS, try to free up more
      disk space for use as a swapfile. When using win95, increase the DPMI 
      memory limit in the properties for your DOS session to 65535 (you'll 
      have to type this in by hand, because the pulldown list doesn't go 
      above 16384).


<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="When_I_run_make__it_says__conflicting_types_for_va_list__">   When I run make, it says "conflicting types for va_list".</a></b></div><br>

<p>
      As the error message suggests, there is a conflict between newer
      versions of gcc and older versions of the libc. You must upgrade your
      djdevxxx.zip package to the latest update (timestamp 11 August 2002)
      of DJGPP-2.03 or above.

<div class="al-api"><b><a name="When_I_try_to_compile_a_program_using_Allegro__I_get_lots_of_errors_like_">   When I try to compile a program using Allegro, I get lots of errors like:</a></b></div><br>

   C:\TEMP\ccdaaaaa(.text+0xe):x.c: undefined reference to <tt>`install_keyboard'</tt><br>

<p>
      You haven't read the docs, have you? :-) You need to link your program 
      with the library file, <tt>liballeg.a</tt>. First, make sure you have installed
      everything properly (running <tt>make install</tt> should do this for you).
      Second, if you are compiling from the command prompt or with a makefile,
      add <tt>-lalleg</tt> to the end of your gcc command line, or if you are using Rhide,
      go to the Options/Libraries menu, type <tt>alleg</tt> into the first empty field,
      and make sure the box next to it is checked.


<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="I_give_up__I_can_t_compile_this__Can_you_send_me_a_precompiled_version_">   I give up: I can't compile this! Can you send me a precompiled version?</a></b></div><br>

<p>
      No, sorry. For starters, <tt>liballeg.a</tt> is about 450k, but you'd probably 
      also want various utilities like the grabber, sound setup, etc. And
      what about all the example programs? If we included compiled versions
      of everything, a binary distribution would be over 7 megs: way too big
      to be practical! More seriously though, there just isn't any reason
      why you can't build it yourself. A compiler is a deterministic
      process: given a particular input file and command line, it will always
      produce the same output. If this isn't working, you either have the
      wrong input files (ie. your copy of Allegro is broken in some way), or
      the wrong command line (it is hard to see how that could happen, since
      all you have to do is type <tt>make</tt>...) or your compiler is broken, ie. you
      didn't install djgpp properly. You need to find and fix the problem,
      not just sweep it under the carpet by getting someone else to compile
      Allegro for you...


<p><br>

<p>
      GNU tools write their error messages to the error stream, <tt>stderr</tt>. 
      Unfortunately <tt>command.com</tt> is too stupid to know how to redirect this, 
      but fortunately DJ was smart enough to work around that, so you can 
      use his redir program to capture the output messages, for example 
      <pre>
         redir -eo make > logfile.txt
      </pre>

<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Does_the_DOS_version_of_Allegro_work_under_Windows_NT_">   Does the DOS version of Allegro work under Windows NT?</a></b></div><br>

<p>
      Your mileage may vary. Some people have reported problems, while 
      others say that it works fine. Use the Windows version of Allegro
      if you want to make Windows programs. If you want to run DOS
      programs, use DOS!


<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Does_Allegro_work_under_OpenDOS_">   Does Allegro work under OpenDOS?</a></b></div><br>

<p>
      Yes, but with some caveats. If you are using the OpenDOS version of

<p>
      You can't. The limit is imposed by the VGA hardware, not by Allegro. 
      To access more than 256k of video memory you need to use an SVGA mode, 
      which means either switching to a higher resolution or getting a copy 
      of the SciTech Display Doctor, which provides several low resolution
      SVGA modes.

<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Does_DOS_Allegro_work_with_the_SB_Live_soundcard_">   Does DOS Allegro work with the SB-Live soundcard?</a></b></div><br>

<p>
      It does for some people, but not for others. The problem is that 
      Creative Labs refuse to release any specs, so we don't know how to 
      write a driver for it. Complain to them, or buy a different card from 
      a more reasonable manufacturer.

<p>
      This might be because you have the volume set very low: try changing 
      this in the setup program. Also, Allegro is mixing several sounds into 
      a single output buffer, unlike the Windows sound player that only 
      plays one sample at a time, so each individual sound can only get a 
      smaller percentage of the total output volume. This is just the price 
      you pay for multiple output channels. If you don't like it, use the 
      setup program to tweak the number of channels: this can be any power 
      of two less than or equal to 64, and the smaller you make it, the 
      louder the sound will be. Alternatively, use <code>set_volume_per_voice()</code>,
      described in the docs. This will enable you to adjust the overall
      volume of Allegro's digital sound output.

      For more general things like the sound, VESA, and mode-X routines, 
      this would be very difficult to do because the drivers depend on a lot 
      of helper functions from the core lib. The djgpp DXE format is nowhere

      dependent on any other dynamic linking packages.

      WIP stands for "work in progress", and refers to any changes that are 
      more recent than the last official release. WIP versions of the 
      library can be obtained as patches from the Allegro website 
      (<a href="http://alleg.sourceforge.net/">http://alleg.sourceforge.net/</a>), and are usually
      quite stable, although obviously not so well tested as a final release 
      version.

      Do you have a copy of <tt>patch.exe</tt>? If not, go and get it from the same

      part of the compiler distribution. Similarly, you can get the Mingw
      compiled version from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/</a>.
      <p>
<p>
      If you do have the patch program but it isn't working properly, make
      sure that you are installing the patch over the top of an unmodified
      copy of whatever Allegro version it is intended to update (this will
      usually be the most recent official release from before the WIP was
      made, but check the text file that comes with the WIP to be sure).

<p>
      This is just the way that the video hardware works: there can only be

      they all use the same palette, or switch to a truecolor graphics mode.

<p>
      The VGA hardware only uses 6 bits for each color component, which 
      means the red, green, and blue values in the palette structure range 
      from 0 to 63, not all the way up to 255. That gives you a potential 
      2^18 = 262144 different colors, or 64 shades of grey. If you need more 
      than this you could try using VESA function <tt>0x4F08</tt> to select an 8 bit 
      wide DAC, but Allegro doesn't support this directly and I don't know

<p>
      When you are in a 256 color mode, the VGA card displays color #0

      black). Your funny color will go away if you change the palette so 
      that color #0 is black.

<p>
      With great difficulty :-) There is no such easy trick as just altering 
      the palette, so you will have to repeatedly redraw the image in a 
      lighter or darker form. You could draw black translucent rectangles 
      over the screen to darken it down, or use <code>draw_lit_sprite()</code> to tint a 
      bitmap while copying it to the screen, but be warned that these 
      operations are expensive and will require a fast PC!
      <p>
<p>
      Also, have a look at <a href="http://www.allegro.cc/">http://www.allegro.cc/</a> for add-on packages
      (notably FBlend v0.5) that attempt to make this operation as fast as

<p>
      You are probably trying to initialise the dialog structure with a 
      pointer to your bitmap, right? That won't work because the dialog is 
      created at compile time, but the bitmap is only loaded at runtime, so 
      the compiler doesn't yet know where it will be located. You need to 
      fill in the dialog structure with a <code>NULL</code> pointer, and then copy the 
      real bitmap pointer into the <code>dp</code> field as part of your program init 
      code, after you've loaded the bitmap into memory.


<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Should_I_use_regular_bitmaps__RLE_sprites__or_compiled_sprites_">   Should I use regular bitmaps, RLE sprites, or compiled sprites?</a></b></div><br>

<p>
      It depends on exactly what you are doing. If your images are totally 
      opaque, there is no advantage to using an RLE sprite, and it will 
      probably be faster to use a regular bitmap with the <code>blit()</code> function. 
      If your graphics contain masked areas, an RLE sprite may be both smaller
      and faster than the <code>draw_sprite()</code> function, depending on your CPU
      and your bitmaps.
      Compiled sprites are in general quite a bit faster than both the 
      others for masked images, and slightly faster for opaque graphics, but 
      this is far more variable. They are at their best with small sprites, 
      on older machines and in mode-X, and may actually be slower than 
      <code>blit()</code> when using SVGA modes on a pentium (the large size of a

      You need to make sure the game logic gets updated at a regular rate, 
      but skip the screen refresh every now and then if the computer is too 
      slow to keep up. This can be done by installing a timer handler that 
      will increment a global variable at your game logic speed, eg:
<blockquote class="code"><pre>
      volatile int speed_counter = 0;

      void increment_speed_counter()
      {
         speed_counter++;
      }

      END_OF_FUNCTION(increment_speed_counter)

      void play_the_game()
      {
         LOCK_VARIABLE(speed_counter);
         LOCK_FUNCTION(increment_speed_counter);

         install_int_ex(increment_speed_counter, BPS_TO_TIMER(60));

         while (!game_over) {
            while (speed_counter &gt; 0) {
               update_game_logic();
               speed_counter--;
            }

            update_display();
         }
      }</pre></blockquote>

      Add a call to <code>save_bitmap()</code> somewhere in your code. See the

      when doing this, and some example code.

<p>
      There is no need. The linker will only include the parts of the 
      library that you actually use, so if you don't call any of, say, the 
      texture mapping or FLIC playing functions, they will be left out of 
      your executable. This doesn't work perfectly because a lot of the 
      Allegro code uses tables of function pointers that cause some 
      unnecessary routines to be linked in, so the majority of the graphics 
      functions will be included in every executable, but I have tried to 
      keep this to a minimum. See <tt><a href="allegro.html">allegro.txt</a></tt> for information about more 
      precise ways to remove some of the graphics and sound drivers.

<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Will_you_ever_add_support_for_3D_accelerator_hardware_">   Will you ever add support for 3D accelerator hardware?</a></b></div><br>

<p>
      No. This sort of hardware support would be most useful as part of a 
      proper 3D API, which Allegro is not, and will never be. If you want
      to do some work on this, the MESA library (a free implementation 
      of OpenGL) is IMHO the place to start.
      <p>
<p>
      However, if you are interested in using OpenGL for graphics and Allegro
      for everything else, you can try the various add-ons libraries linked
      from <a href="http://www.allegro.cc/">http://www.allegro.cc/</a> such as AllegroGL.

<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Why_not_add_a_MOD_playing_function_">   Why not add a MOD playing function?</a></b></div><br>

<p>
      Several very good ones already exist, for instance the JGMOD or DUMB
      packages. See the audio library extensions section on the Allegro.cc
      website (<a href="http://www.allegro.cc/">http://www.allegro.cc/</a>). You are not allowed to suggest
      that one of these libraries be merged into Allegro, because this topic
      has already been done to death on the mailing list and we are tired of it.


<p><br>
<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Why_not_add_networking_support_">   Why not add networking support?</a></b></div><br>

<p>
      There are several networking packages currently in development or 
      floating around on the net, though, and in our opinion this sort of 
      code is more useful as an external library than it would be as part of 
      Allegro.

<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Why_can_t_Allegro_read_GIF_files_">   Why can't Allegro read GIF files?</a></b></div><br>

<p>
      Unisys has a patent on the LZW compression algorithm that is used by 
      the GIF format. We want everything in Allegro to be freely usable 
      without any restrictions whatsoever, which means we can't include any 
      code that is subject to licensing or the payment of royalties.

<p>
      Perhaps. Try to isolate the smallest fragment of code that is able to 
      reproduce the problem, and we'll have a look at it. If you can send us 
      a 10 line program, we will fix it. 100 lines, and we can probably fix 
      it. 1000 lines, and we don't have a chance :-)

<p>
      It simplifies the maintenance of your program, in case the value of PI 
      ever needs to be changed. Also it will make your program more portable 
      to other compilers that use different values of PI.

<div class="al-api"><b><a name="Why_doesn_t_vsync___seem_to_work_">   Why doesn't vsync() seem to work?</a></b></div><br>

<p>
      A number of graphics cards have buggy or incomplete VESA
      implementations, and often the <code>vsync()</code> function is not implemented. For
      examples on flicker-free drawing, look at the code for the demo game shooter,
      which uses a variety of methods to draw itself.

<p>
      If the code works without optimisations, then it could be the
      compiler's fault. You can try beating the compiler into submission,
      for example:
<blockquote class="code"><pre>
      while (!key[KEY_ENTER])
         rest(0);</pre></blockquote>

<p>
      For this case, however, it would be better to use <code>readkey()</code> instead.
      Or consider upgrading or downgrading your compiler.

      You are probably declaring the use of a namespace before including

      #include &lt;iostream&gt;

      #include &lt;allegro.h&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>
      Move the <tt>`using'</tt> declaration after the <tt>`include'</tt> directives referring
      to Allegro headers:
<blockquote class="code"><pre>
      #include &lt;iostream&gt;
