.SH NAME
BITMAP \- Stores the contents of a bitmap. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B typedef struct BITMAP
.SH DESCRIPTION

.nf
   int w, h;               - size of the bitmap in pixels
   int clip;               - non-zero if clipping is turned on
   int cl, cr, ct, cb;     - clip rectangle left, right, top,
                             and bottom
   unsigned char *line[];  - pointers to the start of each line
   
.fi
There is some other stuff in the structure as well, but it is liable to
change and you shouldn't use anything except the above. The `w' and `h'
fields can be used to obtain the size of an existing bitmap:

.nf
   bmp = load_bitmap("file.bmp", pal);
   allegro_message("Bitmap size: (%dx%d)\\n", bmp->w, bmp->h);
   
.fi
The clipping rectangle is inclusive on the left and top (0 allows drawing
to position 0) but exclusive on the right and bottom (10 allows drawing
to position 9, but not to 10). Note this is not the same format as that of
the clipping API, which takes inclusive coordinates for all four corners.
All the values of this structure should be regarded as read-only, with the
exception of the line field, whose access is described in depth in the
"Direct access to video memory" section of the manual. If you want to
modify the clipping region, please refrain from changing this structure.
Use set_clip_rect() instead.
