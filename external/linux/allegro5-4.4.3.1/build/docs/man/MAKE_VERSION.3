MAKE_VERSION \- Create a 32 bit integer from the Allegro version\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B Macro MAKE_VERSION(a, b, c)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This macro can be used to check if some Allegro version is (binary)
compatible with the current version. It is safe to use > and < to
check if one version is more recent than another.
The third number is ignored if the second number is even, so
MAKE_VERSION(4, 2, 0) is equivalent to MAKE_VERSION(4, 2, 1).
This is because of our version numbering policy since 4.0.0:
the second number is even for stable releases, which must be
ABI-compatible with earlier versions of the same series.
This macro is mainly useful for addon packages and libraries. See the 
`ABI compatibility information' section of the manual for more detailed 
information. Example:

.nf
   /* Check if the current version is compatible with Allegro 4.2.0 */
   #if (MAKE_VERSION(4, 2, 0) <= MAKE_VERSION(ALLEGRO_VERSION, \\
                      ALLEGRO_SUB_VERSION, ALLEGRO_WIP_VERSION))
      /* Allegro 4.2.0 compatibility */
   #else
      /* Work-around */
   #endif
