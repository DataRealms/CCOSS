.SH DESCRIPTION
A packfile structure, similar to the libc FILE structure. Read chapter
"File and compression routines" for a description on how to obtain/use
this structure. Note that prior to version 4.1.18, some internal fields
were accidentally documented - but PACKFILE should be treated as an
opaque structure, just like the libc FILE type.
