.SH DESCRIPTION
Render translucent textures. All the general rules for drawing
translucent things apply. However, these modes have a major
limitation: they only work with memory bitmaps or linear frame
buffers (not with banked frame buffers). Don't even try, they do not
check and your program will die horribly (or at least draw wrong
things).
