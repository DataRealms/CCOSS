POLYTYPE_GCOL \- Polygon rendering mode type Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B #define POLYTYPE_GCOL
.SH DESCRIPTION
A single-color gouraud shaded polygon. The colors for each vertex are taken
from the `c' value, and interpolated across the polygon. This is very fast,
but will only work in 256-color modes if your palette contains a smooth
gradient between the colors. In truecolor modes it interprets the color as
a packed, display-format value as produced by the makecol() function.
