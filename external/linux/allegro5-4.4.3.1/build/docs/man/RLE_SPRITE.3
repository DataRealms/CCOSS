RLE sprites store the image in a simple run-length encoded format, where
repeated zero pixels are replaced by a single length count, and strings of
non-zero pixels are preceded by a counter giving the length of the solid
run. Read chapter "RLE sprites" for a description of the restrictions and
how to obtain/use this structure.
