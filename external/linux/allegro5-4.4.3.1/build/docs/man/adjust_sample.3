.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B void adjust_sample(const SAMPLE *spl, int vol, int pan, int freq, int loop);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Alters the parameters of a sample while it is playing (useful for
manipulating looped sounds). You can alter the volume, pan, and frequency,
and can also clear the loop flag, which will stop the sample when it next
reaches the end of its loop. The values of the parameters are just like
those of play_sample(). If there are several copies of the same sample
playing, this will adjust the first one it comes across. If the sample is
not playing it has no effect.
