.SH NAME
apply_quat \- Multiplies a point by a quaternion. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B void apply_quat(const QUAT *q, float x, y, z, *xout, *yout, *zout);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Multiplies the point (x, y, z) by the quaternion q, storing the result in 
(*xout, *yout, *zout). This is quite a bit slower than apply_matrix_f(), 
so only use it to translate a few points. If you have many points, it is 
much more efficient to call quat_to_matrix() and then use 
apply_matrix_f().
