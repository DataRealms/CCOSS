.SH NAME
canonicalize_filename \- Converts any filename into its canonical form. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B char *canonicalize_filename(char *dest, const char *filename, int size);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Converts any filename into its canonical form, i.e. the minimal absolute
filename describing the same file and fixing incorrect forward/backward
slashes for the current platform, storing at most `size' bytes into the
`dest' buffer. You can use the same buffer both as input and output
because Allegro internally works on a copy of the input before touching
`dest'. Example:

.nf
   char buf[256];
   ...
   canonicalize_filename(buf, "~/../s22/..\\\\t3st///hi.c",
                         sizeof(buf));
   /* Running this under Unix would
      return: /home/t3st/hi.c */
   
.fi
Note that this function won't work as expected if the path to canonicalize
comes from another platform (eg. a "c:\\something" path will canonicalize
into something really wrong under Unix: "/current/path/c:/something").
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns a copy of the `dest' parameter.
