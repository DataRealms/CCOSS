.SH NAME
create_zbuffer \- Creates a Z-buffer for a bitmap. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B ZBUFFER *create_zbuffer(BITMAP *bmp);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Creates a Z-buffer using the size of the BITMAP you are planning to draw
on. Several Z-buffers can be defined but only one can be used at the same
time, so you must call set_zbuffer() to make this Z-buffer active.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns the pointer to the ZBUFFER or NULL if there was an error. Remember
to destroy the ZBUFFER once you are done with it, to avoid having memory
leaks.
