.SH NAME
d_check_proc \- Dialog procedure implementing a check box object. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int d_check_proc(int msg, DIALOG *d, int c);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an example of how you can derive objects from other objects. Most 
of the functionality comes from d_button_proc(), but it displays itself 
as a check box. If the d1 field is non-zero, the text will be printed to 
the right of the check, otherwise it will be on the left.

Note: the object width should allow space for the text as well as the
check box (which is square, with sides equal to the object height).
