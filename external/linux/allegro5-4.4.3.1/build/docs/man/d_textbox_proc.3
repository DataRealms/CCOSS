.SH DESCRIPTION
A text box object. The dp field points to the text which is to be 
displayed in the box. If the text is long, there will be a vertical 
scrollbar on the right hand side of the object which can be used to 
scroll through the text. The default is to print the text with word 
wrapping, but if the D_SELECTED flag is set, the text will be printed 
with character wrapping. The d1 field is used internally to store the 
number of lines of text, and d2 is used to store how far it has scrolled 
through the text.
