.SH NAME
desktop_color_depth \- Finds out the desktop color depth. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int desktop_color_depth();
.SH DESCRIPTION
Finds out the currently selected desktop color depth. You can use this
information to make your program use the same color depth as the desktop,
which will likely make it run faster because the graphic driver won't be
doing unnecessary color conversions behind your back.

Under some OSes, switching to a full screen graphics mode may automatically
change the desktop color depth. You have, therefore, to call this function
before setting any graphics mode in order to retrieve the real desktop
color depth. Example:

.nf
   allegro_init();
   ...
   if ((depth = desktop_color_depth()) != 0) {
      set_color_depth(depth);
   }
.fi
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns the color depth or zero on platforms where this information is not
available or does not apply.
