.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int do_dialog(DIALOG *dialog, int focus_obj);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The basic dialog manager function. This displays a dialog (an array of 
dialog objects, terminated by one with a NULL dialog procedure), and sets 
the input focus to the focus_obj (-1 if you don't want anything to have 
the focus). It interprets user input and dispatches messages as they are 
required, until one of the dialog procedures tells it to close the 
dialog, at which point it returns the index of the object that caused it 
to exit, or until ESC is pressed, at which point it returns -1.
