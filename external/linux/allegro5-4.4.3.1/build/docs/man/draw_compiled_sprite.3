.SH NAME
draw_compiled_sprite \- Draws a compiled sprite. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B void draw_compiled_sprite(BITMAP *bmp, const COMPILED_SPRITE *sprite,
.B int x, int y);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Draws a compiled sprite onto a bitmap at the specified position. The 
sprite must have been compiled for the correct type of bitmap (linear or 
planar). This function does not support clipping.

Hint: if not being able to clip compiled sprites is a problem, a neat 
trick is to set up a work surface (memory bitmap, mode-X virtual screen, 
or whatever) a bit bigger than you really need, and use the middle of it 
as your screen. That way you can draw slightly off the edge without any 
trouble...
