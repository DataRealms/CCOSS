.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int file_select_ex(const char *message, char *path, const char *ext,
.B int size, int w, int h);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Displays the Allegro file selector, with the message as caption. The path 
parameter contains the initial filename to display (this can be used to 
set the starting directory, or to provide a default filename for a 
save-as operation). The user selection is returned by altering the path 
buffer, whose maximum capacity in bytes is specified by the size parameter.
Note that it should have room for at least 80 characters (not bytes),
so you should reserve 6x that amount, just to be sure. The list of files
is filtered according to the file extensions in the ext parameter.
Passing NULL includes all files; "PCX;BMP" includes only files with
.PCX or .BMP extensions. If you wish to control files by their attributes,
one of the fields in the extension list can begin with a slash, followed
by a set of attribute characters. Any attribute written on its own, or
with a '+' before it, indicates to include only files which have that
attribute set. Any attribute with a '-' before it indicates to leave out
any files with that attribute. The flag characters are 'r' (read-only),
'h' (hidden), 's' (system), 'd' (directory) and 'a' (archive). For
example, an extension string of "PCX;BMP;/+r-h" will display only PCX or
BMP files that are read-only and not hidden. The directories are not
affected in the same way as the other files by the extension string: the
extensions are never taken into account for them and the other attributes
are taken into account only when 'd' is mentioned in the string; in other
words, all directories are included when 'd' is not mentioned in the
string. The file selector is stretched to the width and height specified
in the w and h parameters, and to the size of the standard Allegro font.
If either the width or height argument is set to zero, it is stretched
to the corresponding screen dimension. This function returns zero if it
was closed with the Cancel button or non-zero if it was OK'd.
