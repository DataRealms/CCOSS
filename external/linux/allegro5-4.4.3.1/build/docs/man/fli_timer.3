.SH NAME
fli_timer \- Global variable for timing FLI playback. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B extern volatile int fli_timer;
.SH DESCRIPTION
Global variable for timing FLI playback. When you open an FLI file, a 
timer interrupt is installed which increments this variable every time a 
new frame should be displayed. Calling next_fli_frame() decrements it, so 
you can test it and know that it is time to display a new frame if it is 
greater than zero. Example:

.nf
   while (next_fli_frame(0) == FLI_OK) {
      /* Do stuff, like play audio stream
         or check keys to skip animation. */
      /* Rest some time until next frame... */
      while (fli_timer <= 0)
         rest(0);
   }
