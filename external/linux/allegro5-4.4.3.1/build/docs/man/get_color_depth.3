.SH NAME
get_color_depth \- Returns the current pixel color depth. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int get_color_depth(void);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Returns the current pixel format. This can be very useful to know in order
to write generic functions which select a different code path internally
depending on the color depth being used.

Note that the function returns whatever value you may have set previously
with set_color_depth(), which can be different from the current color
depth of the screen global variable. If you really need to know the color
depth of the screen, use bitmap_color_depth().
