.SH NAME
get_filename \- Returns a pointer to the filename portion of a path. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B char *get_filename(const char *path);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Finds out the filename portion of a completely specified file path. Both
`\\' and `/' are recognized as directory separators under DOS and Windows.
However, only `/' is recognized as directory separator under other
platforms. Example:

.nf
   get_executable_name(name, sizeof(name));
   allegro_message("Running `%s'\\n", get_filename(name));
   
.fi
Note that Allegro won't perform any IO operations during the verification.
This means that if you have `/a/path/like/this/', which doesn't have a
filename, the function will return a pointer to the trailing null
character. However, if you have `/a/path/like/this', Allegro will return
a pointer to `this', even if it is a valid directory.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns a pointer to the portion of `path' where the filename starts, or
the beginning of `path' if no valid filename is found (eg. you are
processing a path with backslashes under Unix).
