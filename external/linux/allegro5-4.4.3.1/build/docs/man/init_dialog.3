.SH NAME
init_dialog \- Low level initialisation of a dialog. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B DIALOG_PLAYER *init_dialog(DIALOG *dialog, int focus_obj);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function provides lower level access to the same functionality as
do_dialog(), but allows you to combine a dialog box with your own program 
control structures. It initialises a dialog, returning a pointer to a 
player object that can be used with update_dialog() and 
shutdown_dialog(). With these functions, you could implement your own 
version of do_dialog() with the lines:

.nf
   DIALOG_PLAYER *player = init_dialog(dialog, focus_obj);
   
   while (update_dialog(player))
      ;
   
   return shutdown_dialog(player);
.fi

Note that you are responsible for showing and hiding the mouse cursor, which
do_dialog would otherwise do for you, or saving and restoring the screen
contents, as popup_dialog would do for you.
