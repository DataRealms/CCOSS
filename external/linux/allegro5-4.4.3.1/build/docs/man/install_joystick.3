.SH NAME
install_joystick \- Initialises the joystick. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int install_joystick(int type);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Installs Allegro's joystick handler, and calibrates the centre position
values. The type parameter should usually be JOY_TYPE_AUTODETECT, or see
the platform specific documentation for a list of the available drivers.
You must call this routine before using any other joystick functions, and
you should make sure that all joysticks are in the middle position at the
time. Example:

.nf
   textout_centre_ex(screen, font,
                     "Center the joystick and press a key",
                     SCREEN_W/2, SCREEN_H/2, red_color, -1);
   readkey();
   if (install_joystick(JOY_TYPE_AUTODETECT) != 0)
      abort_on_error("Error initialising joystick!");
.fi
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns zero on success. As soon as you have installed the joystick 
module, you will be able to read the button state and digital (on/off 
toggle) direction information, which may be enough for some games. If you 
want to get full analogue input, though, you need to use the 
calibrate_joystick() functions to measure the exact range of the inputs: 
see below.
