.SH NAME
install_mouse \- Installs the Allegro mouse handler.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int install_mouse();
.SH DESCRIPTION
Installs the Allegro mouse handler. You must do this before using any 
other mouse functions. 
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns -1 on failure, zero if the mouse handler is already installed (in
which case this function does nothing) and the number of buttons on the
mouse if the mouse handler has successfully been installed (ie. this is
the first time a handler is installed or you have removed the previous
one).

Note that the number of mouse buttons returned by this function is more
an indication than a physical reality. With most devices there is no way
of telling how many buttons there are, and any user can override the
number of mouse buttons returned by this function with a custom
configuration file and the variable num_buttons. Even if this value is
overridden by the user, the global mouse variables will still report
whatever the hardware is sending.
