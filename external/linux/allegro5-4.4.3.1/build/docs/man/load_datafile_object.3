.SH NAME
load_datafile_object \- Loads a specific object from a datafile. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B DATAFILE *load_datafile_object(const char *filename, 
.B const char *objectname);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Loads a specific object from a datafile. This won't work if you strip the 
object names from the file, and it will be very slow if you save the file 
with global compression. Example:

.nf
   /* Load only the music from the datafile. */
   music_object = load_datafile_object("datafile.dat",
                                       "MUSIC");
   /* Play it and wait a moment for it. */
   play_midi(music_object->dat);
   ...
   /* Destroy unneeded music. */
   unload_datafile_object(music_object);
.fi
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns a pointer to a single DATAFILE element whose `dat' member points to
the object, or NULL if there was an error or there was no object with the
requested name. Remember to free this DATAFILE later to avoid memory leaks,
but use the correct unloading function!
