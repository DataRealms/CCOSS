.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int load_joystick_data(const char *filename);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Restores calibration data previously stored by save_joystick_data() or 
the setup utility. This sets up all aspects of the joystick code: you 
don't even need to call install_joystick() if you are using this 
function. Pass a NULL filename to read the data from the currently 
selected configuration file.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns zero on success: if it fails the joystick state is undefined and
you must reinitialise it from scratch.
