.SH NAME
make_trans_font \- Makes a font use transparency. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B void make_trans_font(FONT *f);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function converts a font to use transparency for drawing. That is, each
glyph in the font will be drawn with draw_trans_sprite, so you can use the
same blenders as with draw_trans_sprite to draw the font. One common use of
this is to load a bitmap font with an alpha channel, and therefore get
anti-aliased text output by using Allegro's alpha blender. Here's an example
how to do that:


.nf
   FONT *f = load_font("alphafont.tga", NULL, NULL);
   make_trans_font(f);
   set_alpha_blender();
   textprintf_centre_ex(screen, f, 320, 240, -1, -1, "Anti-aliased Font!");
.fi
