.SH NAME
midi_msg_callback, midi_meta_callback, midi_sysex_callback \- Hook functions allowing you to intercept MIDI player events. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B extern void (*midi_msg_callback)(int msg, int byte1, int byte2);

.B extern void (*midi_meta_callback)(int type, const unsigned char *data, int length);

.B extern void (*midi_sysex_callback)(const unsigned char *data, int length);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Hook functions allowing you to intercept MIDI player events. If set to 
anything other than NULL, these routines will be called for each MIDI 
message, meta-event, and system exclusive data block respectively. They 
will execute in an interrupt handler context, so all the code and data 
they use should be locked, and they must not call any operating system 
functions. In general you just use these routines to set some flags and 
respond to them later in your mainline code.
