.SH NAME
mouse_callback \- User specified mouse callback. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B extern void (*mouse_callback)(int flags);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Called by the interrupt handler whenever the mouse moves or one of the 
buttons changes state. This function must be in locked memory, and must 
execute _very_ quickly! It is passed the event flags that triggered the 
call, which is a bitmask containing any of the values MOUSE_FLAG_MOVE, 
MOUSE_FLAG_LEFT_DOWN, MOUSE_FLAG_LEFT_UP, MOUSE_FLAG_RIGHT_DOWN, 
MOUSE_FLAG_RIGHT_UP, MOUSE_FLAG_MIDDLE_DOWN, MOUSE_FLAG_MIDDLE_UP, and 
MOUSE_FLAG_MOVE_Z. Note that even if the mouse has more than three buttons,
only the first three can be trapped using a callback.
