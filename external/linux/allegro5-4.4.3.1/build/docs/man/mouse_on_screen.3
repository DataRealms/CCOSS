drawing the mouse pointer yourself. Other possible uses include the 
ability to pause your game when the mouse goes off of the window, or 
only scrolling the view when the pointer is near the edge of the window,
but not while off of the window.

Example :

.nf
   if (mouse_on_screen()) {draw_sprite(buffer , mouse_sprite , mouse_x , mouse_y);}
   
.fi

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 0 if the mouse pointer is off of the screen, or non-zero otherwise.
