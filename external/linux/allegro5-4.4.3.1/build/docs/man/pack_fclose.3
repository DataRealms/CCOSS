.SH DESCRIPTION
Closes the stream `f' previously opened with pack_fopen() or
pack_fopen_vtable(). After you have closed the stream, performing
operations on it will yield errors in your application (e.g. crash it) or
even block your OS.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns zero on success. On error, returns an error code which is also
stored in `errno'. This function can fail only when writing to files: if
the file was opened in read mode, it will always succeed.
