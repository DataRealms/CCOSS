.SH DESCRIPTION
Pushes the current configuration state (filename, variable values, etc). 
onto an internal stack, allowing you to select some other config source 
and later restore the current settings by calling pop_config_state(). 
This function is mostly intended for internal use by other library 
functions, for example when you specify a config filename to the 
save_joystick_data() function, it pushes the config state before 
switching to the file you specified.
