.SH DESCRIPTION
Releases a sound card voice, indicating that you are no longer interested 
in manipulating it. The sound will continue to play, and any resources 
that it is using will automatically be freed when it finishes. This is 
essentially the same as deallocate_voice(), but it waits for the sound to 
stop playing before taking effect.
