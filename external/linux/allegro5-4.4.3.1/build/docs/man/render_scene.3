.SH NAME
render_scene \- Renders all the queued scene polygons. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B void render_scene();
.SH DESCRIPTION
Renders all the specified scene_polygon3d()'s on the bitmap passed to
clear_scene(). Rendering is done one scanline at a time, with no pixel
being processed more than once.

Note that between clear_scene() and render_scene() you shouldn't change
the clip rectangle of the destination bitmap. For speed reasons, you
should set the clip rectangle to the minimum.

Note also that all the textures passed to scene_polygon3d() are stored as
pointers only and actually used in render_scene().
