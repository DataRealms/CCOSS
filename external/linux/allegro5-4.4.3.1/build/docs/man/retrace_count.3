.SH NAME
retrace_count \- Retrace count simulator. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B extern volatile int retrace_count;
.SH DESCRIPTION
If the retrace simulator is installed, this count is incremented on each
vertical retrace; otherwise, if the refresh rate is known, the count is
incremented at the same rate (ignoring retraces); otherwise, it is
incremented 70 times a second. This provides a way of controlling
the speed of your program without installing user timer functions.
