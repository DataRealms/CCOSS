.SH NAME
set_projection_viewport \- Sets the viewport used to scale the output of persp_project(). Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B void set_projection_viewport(int x, int y, int w, int h);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Sets the viewport used to scale the output of the persp_project()
function. Pass the dimensions of the screen area you want to draw onto,
which will typically be 0, 0, SCREEN_W, and SCREEN_H. Also don't forget
to pass an appropriate aspect ratio to get_camera_matrix later. The
width and height you specify here will determine how big your viewport
is in 3d space. So if an object in your 3D space is w units wide, it
will fill the complete screen when you run into it (i.e., if it has a
distance of 1.0 after the camera matrix was applied. The fov and
aspect-ratio parameters to get_camera_matrix also apply some scaling
though, so this isn't always completely true). If you pass -1/-1/2/2 as
parameters, no extra scaling will be performed by the projection.
