three_finger_flag \- Flag to deactivate the emergency exit key combination. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B extern int three_finger_flag;
.SH DESCRIPTION
The DJGPP keyboard handler provides an 'emergency exit' sequence which
you can use to kill off your program. If you are running under DOS this 
is the three finger salute, ctrl+alt+del. Most multitasking OS's will 
trap this combination before it reaches the Allegro handler, in which 
case you can use the alternative ctrl+alt+end. If you want to disable 
this behaviour in release versions of your program, set this flag to 
FALSE.
