.SH NAME
usetat \- Replaces a character in a string. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int usetat(char *s, int index, int c);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Replaces the character at the specified index in the string with value `c',
handling any adjustments for variable width data (ie. if `c' encodes to a
different width than the previous value at that location). If `index' is
negative, it counts backward from the end of the string. Example:

.nf
   usetat(text_string, 2, letter_a);
.fi
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns the number of bytes by which the trailing part of the string was
moved. This is of interest only with text encoding formats where
characters have a variable length, like UTF-8.
