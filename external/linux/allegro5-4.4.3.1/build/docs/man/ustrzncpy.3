.SH NAME
ustrzncpy \- Copies a string into another one, specifying size. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B char *ustrzncpy(char *dest, int size, const char *src, int n);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is like ustrzcpy() except that no more than `n' characters
from `src' are copied into `dest' whose length in bytes is specified by
`size' and which is guaranteed to be null-terminated even if `src' is
bigger than `size'. If `src' is shorter than `n' characters,
null characters are appended to `dest' as padding until `n' characters have
been written. In any case, `dest' is guaranteed to be null-terminated.

Note that, even for empty strings, your destination string must have at
least enough bytes to store the terminating null character of the string,
and your parameter `size' must reflect this. Otherwise, the debug version
of Allegro will abort at an assertion, and the release version of Allegro
will overrun the destination buffer.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The return value is the value of `dest'.
