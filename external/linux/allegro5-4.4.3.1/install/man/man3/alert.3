.SH NAME
alert \- Displays a popup alert box. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int alert(const char *s1, *s2, *s3, const char *b1, *b2, int c1, c2);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Displays a popup alert box, containing three lines of text (s1-s3), and 
with either one or two buttons. The text for these buttons is passed in 
`b1' and `b2' (`b2' may be NULL), and the keyboard shortcuts in `c1' and
`c2' as ASCII value. Example:

.nf
   if (!exists(CONFIG_FILE))
      alert(CONFIG_FILE, "not found.", "Using defaults.",
            "&Continue", NULL, 'c', 0);
.fi
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 1 or 2 depending on which button was clicked. If the alert is 
dismissed by pressing ESC when ESC is not one of the keyboard shortcuts, 
it treats it as a click on the second button (this is consistent with the 
common "Ok", "Cancel" alert).
