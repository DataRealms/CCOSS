allegro_icon \- Pointer to the Allegro X11 icon.\&

.B extern void *allegro_icon;
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a pointer to the Allegro X11 icon, which is in the format of 
standard .xpm bitmap data.
You do not normally have to bother with this at all: you can use the
xfixicon.sh utility from the tools/x11 directory to convert a true 
colour bitmap to a C file that you only need to link with your own code
to set the icon.
