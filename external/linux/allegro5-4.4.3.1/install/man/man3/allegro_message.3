.SH NAME
allegro_message \- Used mainly to show error messages to users. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B void allegro_message(const char *text_format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Outputs a message, using a printf() format string. Usually you want to
use this to report messages to the user in an OS independent way when some
Allegro subsystem cannot be initialised. But you must not use this function
if you are in a graphic mode, only before calling set_gfx_mode(), or after
a set_gfx_mode(GFX_TEXT). Also, this function depends on a system driver
being installed, which means that it won't display the message at all on
some platforms if Allegro has not been initialised correctly.

On platforms featuring a windowing system, it will bring up a blocking GUI
message box. If there is no windowing system, it will try to print the
string to a text console, attempting to work around codepage differences
by reducing any accented characters to 7-bit ASCII approximations.
Example:

.nf
   if (allegro_init() != 0)
      exit(1);
   
   if (init_my_data() != 0) {
      allegro_message("Sorry, missing game data!\\n");
      exit(2);
   }
