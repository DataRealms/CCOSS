.SH NAME
allocate_voice \- Allocates a sound card voice for a sample. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int allocate_voice(const SAMPLE *spl);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Allocates a sound card voice and prepares it for playing the specified 
sample, setting up sensible default parameters (maximum volume, centre 
pan, no change of pitch, no looping). When you are finished with the 
voice you must free it by calling deallocate_voice() or release_voice().
Allegro can manage up to 256 simultaneous voices, but that limit may be
lower due to hardware reasons.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns the voice number, or -1 if no voices are available.
