.SH NAME
clip3d \- Clips the polygon given in vtx using fixed point math. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int clip3d(int type, fixed min_z, fixed max_z, int vc,
.B const V3D *vtx[], V3D *vout[], V3D *vtmp[], int out[]);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Fixed point version of clip3d_f(). This function should be used with 
caution, due to the limited precision of fixed point arithmetic and high 
chance of rounding errors: the floating point code is better for most 
situations.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns the number of vertices after clipping is done.
