.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int d_edit_proc(int msg, DIALOG *d, int c);
.SH DESCRIPTION
An editable text object (the dp field points to the string). When it has 
the input focus (obtained by clicking on it with the mouse), text can be 
typed into this object. The d1 field specifies the maximum number of 
characters that it will accept, and d2 is the text cursor position within 
the string.

Note: dp must point to a buffer at least (d1 + 1) * 4 bytes long because,
depending on the encoding format in use, a single character can occupy
up to 4 bytes and room must be reserved for the terminating null character.
