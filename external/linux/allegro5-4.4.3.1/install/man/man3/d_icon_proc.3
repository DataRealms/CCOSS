and the bg color for the shadow used to fill in the top and left sides of 
the button when "pressed". d1 is the "push depth", ie. the number of 
pixels the icon will be shifted to the right and down when selected 
(default 2) if there is no "selected" image. d2 is the distance by which 
the dotted line showing focus is indented (default 2). dp points to a 
bitmap for the icon, while dp2 and dp3 are the selected and disabled 
images respectively (optional, may be NULL).
