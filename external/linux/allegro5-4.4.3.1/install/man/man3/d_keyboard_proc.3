d_keyboard_proc \- Invisible dialog procedure for implementing keyboard shortcuts. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int d_keyboard_proc(int msg, DIALOG *d, int c);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an invisible object for implementing keyboard shortcuts. You can 
put an ASCII code in the key field of the dialog object (a character such 
as 'a' to respond to a simple keypress, or a number 1-26 to respond to a 
control key a-z), or you can put a keyboard scancode in the d1 and/or d2 
fields. When one of these keys is pressed, the object will call the 
function pointed to by dp. This should return an int, which will be 
passed back to the dialog manager, so it can return D_O_K, D_REDRAW, 
D_CLOSE, etc.
