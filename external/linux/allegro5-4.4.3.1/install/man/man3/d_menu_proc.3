.SH NAME
d_menu_proc \- Dialog procedure implementing a menu bar object. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int d_menu_proc(int msg, DIALOG *d, int c);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This object is a menu bar which will drop down child menus when it is 
clicked or if an alt+key corresponding to one of the shortcuts in the 
menu is pressed. It ignores a lot of the fields in the dialog structure, 
in particular the color is taken from the gui_*_color variables, and the 
width and height are calculated automatically (the w and h fields from 
the DIALOG are only used as a minimum size.) The dp field points to an 
array of menu structures: see do_menu() for more information. The top 
level menu will be displayed as a horizontal bar, but when child menus 
drop down from it they will be in the normal vertical format used by 
do_menu(). When a menu item is selected, the return value from the menu 
callback function is passed back to the dialog manager, so your callbacks 
should return D_O_K, D_REDRAW, or D_CLOSE.
