d_yield_proc \- Invisible dialog procedure that yields CPU time slices. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int d_yield_proc(int msg, DIALOG *d, int c);
.SH DESCRIPTION
An invisible helper object that yields time slices for the scheduler (if
the system supports it) when the GUI has nothing to do but waiting for
user actions. You should put one instance of this object in each dialog 
array because it may be needed on systems with an unusual scheduling 
algorithm (for instance QNX) in order to make the GUI fully responsive.
