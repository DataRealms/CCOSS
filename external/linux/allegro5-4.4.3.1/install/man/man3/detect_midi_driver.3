.SH NAME
detect_midi_driver \- Detects whether the specified MIDI sound device is available. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int detect_midi_driver(int driver_id);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Detects whether the specified MIDI sound device is available. This function
must be called _before_ install_sound().
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns the maximum number of voices that the driver can provide, or zero
if the hardware is not present.

There are two special-case return values that you should watch out for:
if this function returns -1 it is a note-stealing driver (eg. DIGMID) that
shares voices with the current digital sound driver, and if it returns
0xFFFF it is an external device like an MPU-401 where there is no way to
determine how many voices are available.
