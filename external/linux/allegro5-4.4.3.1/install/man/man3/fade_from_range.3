.SH NAME
fade_from_range \- Gradually fades a part of the palette between two others. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B void fade_from_range(const PALETTE source, const PALETTE dest,
.B int speed, int from, int to);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Gradually fades a part of the palette from the source palette to the dest 
palette. The speed is from 1 (the slowest) up to 64 (instantaneous). This 
routine only affects colors between from and to (inclusive: pass 0 and 
255 to fade the entire palette).

Note that this function will block your game while the fade is in effect,
and it won't work right visually if you are not in an 8 bit color depth
resolution.
