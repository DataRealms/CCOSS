.SH NAME
fixadd \- Safe function to add fixed point numbers clamping overflow. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B fixed fixadd(fixed x, fixed y);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Although fixed point numbers can be added with the normal '+' integer 
operator, that doesn't provide any protection against overflow. If overflow
is a problem, you should use this function instead. It is slower than using
integer operators, but if an overflow occurs it will set `errno' and clamp
the result, rather than just letting it wrap. Example:

.nf
   fixed result;
   /* This will put 5035 into `result'. */
   result = fixadd(itofix(5000), itofix(35));
   /* Sets `errno' and puts -32768 into `result'. */
   result = fixadd(itofix(-31000), itofix(-3000));
   ASSERT(!errno); /* This will fail. */
.fi
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns the clamped result of adding `x' to `y', setting `errno' to ERANGE
if there was an overflow.
