.B int keypressed();
.SH DESCRIPTION
Returns TRUE if there are keypresses waiting in the input buffer. You can
use this to see if the next call to readkey() is going to block or to 
simply wait for the user to press a key while you still update the screen
possibly drawing some animation. Example:

.nf
   while (!keypressed()) {
      /* Show cool animated logo. */
   }
   /* So he skipped our title screen. */
