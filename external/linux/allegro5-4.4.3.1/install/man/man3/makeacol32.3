.SH NAME
makeacol32 \- Converts an RGBA color into a 32-bit display pixel format. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int makeacol32(int r, int g, int b, int a);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Converts an RGBA color into a 32-bit display pixel format, which includes 
an alpha (transparency) value. There are no versions of this routine for 
other color depths, because only the 32-bit format has enough room to 
store a proper alpha channel. You should only use RGBA format colors as 
the input to draw_trans_sprite() or draw_trans_rle_sprite() after calling 
set_alpha_blender(), rather than drawing them directly to the screen.
