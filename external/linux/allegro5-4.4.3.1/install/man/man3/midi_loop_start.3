.B extern long midi_loop_start;

.B extern long midi_loop_end;
.SH DESCRIPTION
The loop start and end points, set by the play_looped_midi() function. 
These may safely be altered while the music is playing, but you should be 
sure they are always set to sensible values (start < end). If you are 
changing them both at the same time, make sure to alter them in the right 
order in case a MIDI interrupt happens to occur in between your two 
writes! Setting these values to -1 represents the start and end of the 
file respectively.
