.SH NAME
play_looped_midi \- Starts playing a MIDI file with a user-defined loop position. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int play_looped_midi(MIDI *midi, int loop_start, int loop_end);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Starts playing a MIDI file with a user-defined loop position. When the 
player reaches the loop end position or the end of the file (loop_end may 
be -1 to only loop at EOF), it will wind back to the loop start point. 
Both positions are specified in the same beat number format as the 
midi_pos variable.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The return value has the same meaning as that of play_midi(): non-zero if
an error occurs, zero otherwise.
