.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int play_midi(MIDI *midi, int loop);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Starts playing the specified MIDI file, first stopping whatever music was 
previously playing. If the loop flag is set to non-zero, the data will be
repeated until replaced with something else, otherwise it will stop at the
end of the file. Passing a NULL pointer will stop whatever music is
currently playing.

Returns non-zero if an error occurs (this may happen if a patch-caching
wavetable driver is unable to load the required samples, or at least it
might in the future when somebody writes some patch-caching wavetable
drivers :-)
