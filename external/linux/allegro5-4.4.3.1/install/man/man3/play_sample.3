.SH NAME
play_sample \- Plays a sample. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int play_sample(const SAMPLE *spl, int vol, int pan, int freq, int loop);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Triggers a sample at the specified volume, pan position, and frequency. 
The parameters `vol' and `pan' range from 0 (min/left) to 255 (max/right).
Frequency is relative rather than absolute: 1000 represents the frequency
that the sample was recorded at, 2000 is twice this, etc. If `loop' is not
zero, the sample will repeat until you call stop_sample(), and can be
manipulated while it is playing by calling adjust_sample(). Example:

.nf
   /* Scream from the left speaker, twice the freq. */
   int sound = play_sample(scream, 255, 0, 2000, 0);
.fi
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns the voice number that was allocated for the sample or negative if
no voices were available.
