.SH NAME
quat_mul \- Multiplies two quaternions. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B void quat_mul(const QUAT *p, const QUAT *q, QUAT *out);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Multiplies two quaternions, storing the result in out. The resulting 
quaternion will have the same effect as the combination of p and q, ie. 
when applied to a point, (point * out) = ((point * p) * q). Any number of 
rotations can be concatenated in this way. Note that quaternion 
multiplication is not commutative, ie. quat_mul(p, q) != quat_mul(q, p).
