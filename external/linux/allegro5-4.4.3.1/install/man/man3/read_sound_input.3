.SH NAME
read_sound_input \- Retrieves the last recorded audio buffer. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int read_sound_input(void *buffer);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Retrieves the most recently recorded audio buffer into the specified 
location. The buffer size can be obtained by checking the return value
from start_sound_input(). You must be sure to call this
function at regular intervals during the recording (typically around 100 
times a second), or some data will be lost. If you are unable to do this 
often enough from the mainline code, use the digi_recorder() callback to 
store the waveform into a larger buffer of your own.

Note: many cards produce a click or popping sound when switching between
record and playback modes, so it is often a good idea to discard the
first buffer after you start a recording. The waveform is always stored
in unsigned format, with stereo data consisting of alternate left/right
samples.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The function will return non-zero if a buffer has been copied or zero if
no new data is yet available (you were too fast checking the input).
