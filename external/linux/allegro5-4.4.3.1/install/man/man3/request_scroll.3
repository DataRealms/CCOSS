.SH NAME
request_scroll \- Queues a hardware scroll request with triple buffering. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int request_scroll(int x, int y);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is used for triple buffering. It requests a hardware scroll 
to the specified position, but returns immediately rather than waiting 
for a retrace. The scroll will then take place during the next vertical 
retrace, but you can carry on running other code in the meantime and use 
the poll_scroll() routine to detect when the flip has actually taken 
place.

Triple buffering is only possible with certain drivers: you can look at the 
GFX_CAN_TRIPLE_BUFFER bit in the gfx_capabilities flag to see if it will 
work with the current driver.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
This function returns zero on success, non-zero otherwise.
