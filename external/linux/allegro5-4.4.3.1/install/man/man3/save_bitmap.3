.SH NAME
save_bitmap \- Saves a bitmap into any supported file format. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int save_bitmap(const char *filename, BITMAP *bmp, const RGB *pal);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Writes a bitmap into a file, using the specified palette, which should be 
an array of 256 RGB structures. The output format is determined from the
filename extension: at present this function supports BMP, PCX and TGA
formats.

Two things to watch out for: on some video cards it may be faster to copy
the screen to a memory bitmap and save the latter, and if you use this to
dump the screen into a file you may end up with an image much larger than
you were expecting, because Allegro often creates virtual screens larger
than the visible screen. You can get around this by using a sub-bitmap to
specify which part of the screen to save, eg:

.nf
   BITMAP *bmp;
   PALETTE pal;
   ...
   get_palette(pal);
   bmp = create_sub_bitmap(screen, 0, 0, SCREEN_W, SCREEN_H);
   save_bitmap("dump.pcx", bmp, pal);
   destroy_bitmap(bmp);
.fi
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns non-zero on error.
