.SH NAME
set_display_switch_callback \- Installs a switching notification callback. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int set_display_switch_callback(int dir, void (*cb)());
.SH DESCRIPTION
Installs a notification callback for the switching mode that was 
previously selected by calling set_display_switch_mode(). The direction 
parameter can either be SWITCH_IN or SWITCH_OUT, depending whether you 
want to be notified about switches away from your program or back to your 
program. You can sometimes install callbacks for both directions at the 
same time, but not every platform supports this. You can install several
switch callbacks, but no more than eight on any platform.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns zero on success, decreasing the number of empty callback slots by
one. Returns -1 if the request is impossible for the current platform or
you have reached the maximum number of allowed callbacks.
