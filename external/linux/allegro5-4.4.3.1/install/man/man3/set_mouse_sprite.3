.B void set_mouse_sprite(BITMAP *sprite);
.SH DESCRIPTION
You don't like Allegro's mouse pointer? No problem. Use this function to
supply an alternative of your own. If you change the pointer and then want
to get Allegro's lovely arrow back again, call set_mouse_sprite(NULL).

As a bonus, set_mouse_sprite(NULL) uses the current palette in choosing
colors for the arrow. So if your arrow mouse sprite looks ugly after
changing the palette, call set_mouse_sprite(NULL).
