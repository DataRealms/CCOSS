.SH NAME
show_mouse \- Tells Allegro to display a mouse pointer on the screen.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B void show_mouse(BITMAP *bmp);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Tells Allegro to display a mouse pointer on the screen. This will only 
work if the timer module has been installed. The mouse pointer will be 
drawn onto the specified bitmap, which should normally be `screen' (see 
later for information about bitmaps). To hide the mouse pointer, call 
show_mouse(NULL). 

Warning: if you draw anything onto the screen while the pointer is 
visible, a mouse movement interrupt could occur in the middle of your 
drawing operation. If this happens the mouse buffering and graphics drawing
code will get confused and will leave 'mouse droppings' all over the 
screen. To prevent this, you must make sure you turn off the mouse 
pointer whenever you draw onto the screen. This is not needed if you are
using a hardware cursor.

Note: you must not be showing a mouse pointer on a bitmap at the time that
the bitmap is destroyed with destroy_bitmap(), e.g. call show_mouse(NULL);
before destroying the bitmap. This does not apply to `screen' since you
never destroy `screen' with destroy_bitmap().
