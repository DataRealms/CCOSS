.SH NAME
show_os_cursor \- Low level function to display the operating system cursor. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B int show_os_cursor(int cursor);
.SH DESCRIPTION
In case you do not need Allegro's mouse cursor API, which automatically
emulates a cursor in software if no other cursor is available, you can
use this low level function to try to display or hide the system cursor
directly. The cursor parameter takes the same values as
select_mouse_cursor. This function is very similar to calling
enable_hardware_cursor, select_mouse_cursor and show_mouse, but will
not try to do anything if no system cursor is available.

The most common use for this function is to just call it once at the
beginning of the program to tell it to display the system cursor inside
the Allegro window. The return value can be used to see if this
succeeded or not. On some systems (e.g. DirectX fullscreen) this is not
supported and the function will always fail, and in other cases only
some of the cursors will work, or in the case of MOUSE_CURSOR_ALLEGRO,
only certain bitmap sizes may be supported.

You never should use show_os_cursor together with the function
show_mouse and other functions affecting it (select_mouse_cursor,
enable_hardware_cursor, disable_hardware_cursor, scare_mouse,
unscare_mouse). They implement the standard high level mouse API, and
don't work together with this low level function.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 0 if a system cursor is being displayed after the function
returns, or -1 otherwise.
