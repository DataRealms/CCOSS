.SH NAME
stretch_blit \- Scales a rectangular area from one bitmap to another. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B void stretch_blit(BITMAP *source, BITMAP *dest,
.B int source_x, source_y, source_width, source_height,
.B int dest_x, dest_y, dest_width, dest_height);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Like blit(), except it can scale images (so the source and destination 
rectangles don't need to be the same size) and requires the source and 
destination bitmaps to be of the same color depth. This routine doesn't 
do as much safety checking as the regular blit(): in particular you must 
take care not to copy from areas outside the source bitmap, and you 
cannot blit between overlapping regions, ie. you must use different 
bitmaps for the source and the destination. Moreover, the source must 
be a memory bitmap. Example:

.nf
   BITMAP *bmp;
   ...
   /* Stretch bmp to fill the screen. */
   stretch_blit(bmp, screen, 0, 0, bmp->w, bmp->h,
                0, 0, SCREEN_W, SCREEN_H);
