.SH NAME
ustrtol \- Converts a string into an integer. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B long ustrtol(const char *s, char **endp, int base);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function converts the initial part of `s' to a signed integer, setting
`*endp' to point to the first unused character, if `endp' is not a NULL
pointer. The `base' argument indicates what base the digits (or letters)
should be treated as. If `base' is zero, the base is determined by looking
for `0x', `0X', or `0' as the first part of the string, and sets the base
used to 16, 16, or 8 if it finds one. The default base is 10 if none of
those prefixes are found. Example:

.nf
   char *endp, *string = "456.203 askdfg";
   int number = ustrtol(string, &endp, 10);
.fi
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns the string converted as a value of type `long int'. If nothing was
converted, returns zero with `*endp' pointing to the beginning of `s'.
