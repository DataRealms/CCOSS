This function is like ustrzcat() except that no more than `n' characters
from `src' are appended to the end of `dest'. If the terminating null
character in `src' is reached before `n' characters have been written, the
null character is copied, but no other characters are written. Note that
`dest' is guaranteed to be null-terminated.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The return value is the value of `dest'.
