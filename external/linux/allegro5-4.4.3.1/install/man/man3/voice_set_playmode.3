voice_set_playmode \- Adjusts the loop status of the specified voice. Allegro game programming library.\&
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <allegro.h>

.sp
.B void voice_set_playmode(int voice, int playmode);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Adjusts the loop status of the specified voice. This can be done while 
the voice is playing, so you can start a sample in looped mode (having 
set the loop start and end positions to the appropriate values), and then 
clear the loop flag when you want to end the sound, which will cause it 
to continue past the loop end, play the subsequent part of the sample, 
and finish in the normal way. The mode parameter is a bitfield containing 
the following values:

PLAYMODE_PLAY

Plays the sample a single time. This is the default if you don't set 
the loop flag.

PLAYMODE_LOOP

Loops repeatedly through the sample, jumping back to the loop start 
position upon reaching the loop end.

PLAYMODE_FORWARD

Plays the sample from beginning to end. This is the default if you 
don't set the backward flag.

PLAYMODE_BACKWARD

Reverses the direction of the sample. If you combine this with the 
loop flag, the sample jumps to the loop end position upon reaching the 
loop start (ie. you do not need to reverse the loop start and end 
values when you play the sample in reverse).

PLAYMODE_BIDIR

When used in combination with the loop flag, causes the sample to 
change direction each time it reaches one of the loop points, so it 
alternates between playing forwards and in reverse.
