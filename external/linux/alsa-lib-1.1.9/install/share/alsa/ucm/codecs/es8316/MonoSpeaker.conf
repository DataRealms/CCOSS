		# BYT/CHT devices with an ES8316 codec use a single speaker
		# connected between the headhpone LOUT and ROUT pins, expecting
		# the output to be in a mono differential mode. Presumably this
		# is done to use the power of both the left and right headphone
		# amplifier channels to allow the speaker to be louder.
		#
		# The ES8316 codec does not have a differential output mode, but
		# we can emulate one by making both channels output the exact
		# same signal by setting the "DAC Mono Mix Switch", combined
		# with setting the "Playback Polarity" control to "R Invert",
		# which applies a 180 degrees phase inversion to the right chan.
